(s/defn connect!
  "Connects to a clojure-like REPL that supports the socket REPL protocol.
Expects host, port, and some callbacks:
* on-start-eval -> a function that'll be called when an evaluation starts
* on-eval -> a function that'll be called when an evaluation ends
* editor-data -> a function that'll be called when a command needs editor's data.
  Editor's data is a map (or a promise that resolves to a map) with the arguments:
    :contents - the editor's contents.
    :filename - the current file's name. Can be nil if file was not saved yet.
    :range - a vector containing [[start-row start-col] [end-row end-col]], representing
      the current selection
* open-editor -> asks the editor to open an editor. Expects a map with `:filename`,
  `:line` and maybe `:contents`. If there's `:contents` key, it defines a \"virtual
  file\" so it's better to open up an read-only editor
* notify -> when something needs to be notified, this function will be called with a map
  containing :type (one of :info, :warning, or :error), :title and :message
* get-config -> when some function needs the configuration from the editor, this fn
  is called without arguments. Need to return a map with the config options.
* get-rendered-results -> gets all results that are rendered on the editor. This is
  used so that the REPL can 'patch' these results when new data appears (think
  of resolving promises in JS)
* on-patch -> patches the result. Optional, if you send a :get-rendered-results
  callback, one will be generated for you
* prompt -> when some function needs an answer from the editor, it'll call this
  callback passing :title, :message, and :arguments (a vector that is composed by
  :key and :value). The callback needs to return a `Promise` with one of the
  :key from the :arguments, or nil if nothing was selected.
* on-copy -> a function that receives a string and copies its contents to clipboard
* on-stdout -> a function that receives a string when some code prints to stdout
* on-stderr -> a function that receives a string when some code prints to stderr
* on-result -> returns a clojure EDN with the result of code
* on-disconnect -> called with no arguments, will disconnect REPLs. Can be called more
than once

Returns a promise that will resolve to a map with two repls: :clj/aux will be used
to autocomplete/etc, :clj/repl will be used to evaluate code."
